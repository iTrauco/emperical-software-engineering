Aligning my background with the world of Software Engineering has been the single greatest personal challenge I faced to date; since my time as a student developer at DigitalCrafts I have have been unable to connect with others because of the a few bad apples in every startup I have been in with that broke me down every chance they got. 

In all three startups, I was the first member of IT on the frontlines of support, touching every level of an org from c-suite to interns; each time I was brought on because of rapid growth which saw the number of employees double or triple in a matter of months. I have experienced the worst of startup culture, through relentless bullying in Slack, belittling emotional tirades from software engineers, phycial threats from project managers who wanted 'mobile hotspots right now', and major internal security and compliance coverups that I was told to delete any/all documentation for.

Not now, but in 10 or 15 years, I see myself as a member of c-suite with a vision I have yet to define, and, I refuse to let anyone under my guidance suffer in silence the way I did, because, in all honesty, it has consumed me to the point of indecision that has manifested itself through imposter-syndrome and fear of connecting with those around me. 

The following words defined the spirit of a passion project called Nerdy Pug Studios that closed overnight in 2018 due to platform-dependence on Etsy... 

**Our evolving identity is a fusion of multiple stereotypical industry traits, combined with a strong respect and adherence to the empirical and evidence-based practice approach methodologies. We're science geeks, and our creations, particularly our harnesses, are the result of extensive research, development, and prototyping.**

## The Hard Question

<details><summary>The question I never expected...</summary>
<p>

A few days after my code school graduation, I reached out to [Jeff Meyerson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-meyerson-05275716/), the creator and host of [The Software Engineering Daily(SEDaily) Podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) via the shows Slack Channel. 

I have been a devoted listener of this show for three years, in the beginning I understood maybe 20% of what they talked about, but I loved it anyway.   

I just wanted to thank him for the work on does on his podcast, and that I just finished after years of being I could never be a software engineer.  

I love the hard questions he asks on his show, and after congratulating me he asked me a something I wasn't expecting... 

He said... 
```
Now that you can program, what are you going to contribute to the world of software, what impact are you going to have?
```

I never was expecting to be asked such a deep question, and I had no answer, so after a few minutes of silence I said, 'Let me get back to you tomorrow.'

The next day, I still had no answer, so I messaged him and said, " I will have to get back to you on this,'to which  which he replied, 

```
Please do I want to know. 
```

It was his question that sent me on an eight month long journey through empirical and scientific paper research to locate an answer... 

In June of last year, when he asked me this, I knew that I wanted to be a future guest on his show; my goal was to do it within 3 years, so I have about 2 years and 4 months left. 

I still have not replied to him to let him, because I need this repo to outline the next 18 - 24 months as a roadmap to the answer I will give him.

## Code School

<details open><summary>This is a work in progress...</summary>
<p>

In the months since my code school graduation, the 00:00:00 timestamps that litter my [DigitalCrafts](https://digitalcrafts.com) GitHub era private repos have enabled me to use the recorded video lectures for a post-mortem analysis of my student developer experience at DigitalCrafts; and the insights I have gained from this process have been life-altering. 


<details><summary>Imposter Syndrome</summary>
<p>

A few years ago, I started a Masters in Information Systems(IS) but stopped taking classes after completing 1/2 of my program because I was plateaued in my IT career due to an ability to code/program. 

I was always been embarrassed by the BA in General Studies on my resume, so much so that I let the self-doubt of imposter syndrome consume me in my post-DigitalCrafts software industry job search. 

My technical/IT background landed me interviews that most code school grads would have been passed over for by HR/IT Recruiters, and I witnessed firsthand the ‘stigma’ of the ‘coding bootcamp graduate’ stereotype that so many Senior SEs hold. 

This 'stigma' is widespread due to the rise of 'nerd-masculinity' in the field of computer science that occurred in 1970s to early 1980s as the sector transitioned from a female dominated one to a male dominated one; and it remains widespread through senior level engineering positions in all sectors. 

<details><summary>NETWORKS OF EXCLUSION IN A GENDERED ORGANIZATION IN THE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY</summary>
<p>

I found the following passage from this [research paper](https://itrau.co/GenderNetworks) particularly insightful on the topic... 

> The masculinization of software and computing occurred later in the 20th century, as again men actively worked to professionalize the field in line with other scientific disciplines, establishing structural and cultural boundaries in ways that excluded women from the field (Misa 2010). Newly-implemented aptitude tests and personality profiling in hiring processes, for example, privileged masculine characteristics. Increasingly specialized job titles and hierarchies distanced high-skilled labor from work seen as low status and routine, offering increased social status, greater autonomy, better pay, and improved opportunities for advancement for men (Ensmenger 2010). As men solidified their hold over computing and engineering, computer culture became associated with “nerds” – young, white, educated men who “tinker” with technology.

## The Missing Years... 

<details><summary>2010 - 2012</summary>
<p>

Is that I am/was a nurse, I graduated from Gordon State College in December 2012 with an Associates of Science in Nursing and immediately passed my NCLEX for my RN license; which I let expire years ago after joining the ranks of Apple corporate. 

I worked professionally as a nurse for a month before quitting, the emotional toll of a career surrounded by illness and death and loosing patients on a daily basis was something I could not do. 

The science of modern day nursing education is housed in a school of scientific inquiry and thought known as evidence-based practice(EBP); which requires, at its core, strict and unwavering adherence to the scientific method in the clinical decision making process for the gathering, collection, and analysis of nursing process interventions. 

Basically, the human body is viewed as a collection of interconnected systems that, in the absence of homeostatic equilibrium, results the breakdown of things over time… 

Blood lab values, toxicology reports, vital signs, urine labs, etc, serve the purpose of providing quantitative data that modern day nurses interpret based on the presenting signs and symptoms of a patient to determine the best steps to take with the end goal of reestablishing a patients natural homeostatic state.

<details><summary>2017: Part I</summary>
<p>

**Part I**

I went into 2017 with a business plan to bootstrap Nerdy Pug Studios into a full fledge startup; I had contacts in the pet industry that wanted to fund me, but I said no. 

Long story short, operationally and product wise I did well, I was able to use the Etsy Wholeseller Market Place to an amazing success of 80k in sales. 

I failed with the people part, I paid my contractors well, I only needed them during batch orders. The problem is that everytime I found someone and trained them, other places they contracted with would need them at the same time as me. 

There are 20+ multi-million dollar a year dog collar shops on Etsy, and not a single one of them have a background in product design, textiles, or industrial process design; and their creations are the most unsafe, non-tested things ever.

I have deep contacts in the pet industry from a company I at 18; Scoop D'Poo: South Atlanta's Pooper Scooper, which I turned into a small fleet of trucks, contractors, pet sitters, and dog walkers within a year... 

There's articles about it online if you want to Google it. 

**Part II**

I have never worked in a traditional corporate IT environment, besides a two 3  week long stints as IT Support temp at the Carter Center in 2017.

President Jimmy Carter has always been an idol and source of inspiration for me; I met him and Rosalyn several times, and, one time, I had the unexpected pleasure of sitting right beside him at lunch got to ask him about his friendship with Steve Jobs. 

The Carters were one of the first people in the world to receive an iPhone, months before it came out as a gift from Steve Jobs himself. 

I loved the Carter Center, but the pace of things was to slow for me… 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>2017: Part II</summary>
<p>

When I officially made the decision to enter the world of startups; I was confident in my abilities and intellect. 

I left Apple under the impression and false-belief that every startup and tech firm in existence had a culture just like Apple, which I defined by my experience under Tara Bunch’s ‘One Apple’ vision, where everyone treated everyone as equals and treated with the same respect and kindness as our customers. 

Only once, in my entire history with the company, did I witness an Apple employee go irate, I mean just totally ballistic, on another Apple employee.

If I remember correctly, this girl had been sent by her manager in a totally different department with an envelope that contained bad news for whatever was stressing these teams out.

Within 60 seconds, every member of member of management within earshot had dropped it all to intervene.

I entered the world of startups as the ‘Apple’ IT guy at a startup that is now defunk in the summer of 2017 out of a co-working space I will not disclose the name of…

The situation of this startup was like this…

- HQ was based on the west coast

- Atlanta was selected as the location for their flagship ‘second’ office to house engineering and sales due to the ‘founders city’ label of Atlanta

- Rapid growth from a fresh infusion of VC funding meant HR had to fill 40 - 60 positions in just 60 - 90 days for onsite and remote; within a week HR had become PeopleOps and I became an employee of an outsourced human resources app after starting on a 1099

- Overnight, priorities shifted, and new co-working offices are opened with even more employees needing Macs and SaaS app access

- The Software Engineer who was kinda-sorta my manager jumps ship during my second week for a new opportunity and I become the sole IT Admin responsible for all SaaS apps, MacBook Pros, and technical support

- The Help Desk that had been setup was a web app that cost $8 a month

- All Macs were purchased online at Apple.com for pickup at the Lenox Store; I still have no idea whose idea this was

- I had no dedicated space to setup Macs, ship, etc... 

I won’t go into any granular details, but this place broke me; it was, by far, the most vicious and toxic environment I have ever been in.

I was so committed to making it work and to be viewed as a ‘team player,’ that I allowed myself to be an emotional punching bag for Senior SEs and Project Managers that belittled me to the point of tears some evenings.

Since I had no dedicated space, I came in during the evening hours to setup and ship systems, and it was during these hours that I was subject to this harassment; it was equivalent to that one incident I saw at Apple…

I became so afraid, I lived on eggshells and ‘Don’t shoot I’m not a messenger’ became a phrase I would say if I walked by someone I wasn’t sure of… 

I was in this role for three months, and I have never spoken about it or mentioned it on my resume/LinkedIn because it was an experience I simply wanted to ignore and forget…

## EBP in Software Engineering 

<details><summary>Is known as Empirical Software Engineering...</summary>
<p>

Technology, distributed computer systems, coding workflows, networks, etc, are nothing more then interconnected systems that breakdown over time just like the human body, with performance and monitoring metrics/KPIs as the equivalent of toxicology screenings and blood lab values in the operational decisions making process of corrective systems ops interventions. 

Evidence-based practice approach methodologies in the realm of software engineering and design are relatively new concepts, until recently, EBP empiricism simply did not exist in this field. 

I now know that it was this lack of EBP at the heart of my struggles to grasp something as simple as Test Driven Development(TDD); even though I had long demonstrated a technical prowess for the single-direction logic of organizational Domain Driven Design(DDD) on teams in where the TDD subset of Behavorial Driven Design(BDD) was the norm. 

After months of objective reflection and analysis, I finally located EBP in this field, where is more commonly referred to as Emperical Software Engineering(ESE), but, for the sake of simplicity and habit, I call it Evidence-based Software Design(EBSD). 
</p>
</details>

<!------------------------------------------------>
<!------------------------------------------------>
## EBP is Interdisciplinary

<details><summary>An Evolving Perspective...</summary>
<p>

Four years ago, I wrote the following words in my last undergraduate [research paper](itrau.co/soviettech)...

<details><summary> How Gorbachev's Reforms Synergized the Intentions of the Reagan Doctrine</summary>
<p>

> To highlight the nature of the inefficiencies plaguing the Soviet Union’s industrial capabilities, a review of the technological challenges faced by Gorbachev when he assumed the Office of the General Secretary provides sufficient illustration(Gibbs, 11-14). In 1977, the last year of reliable data, there were an estimated 20,000 computers in the entire Soviet Union, compared to 325,000 in the United States alone(Bailer, 77). It is estimated that by the mid-1980s, there were 25 computers in the United States for every 1 in the Soviet Union, a ratio of 25/1(Bailer, 77).  With a twenty year headstart on research in the newly emerged field of computer science, the West leveraged the power of the microprocessor to automate tasks, calculate vast quantities of data in ever shorter periods of time, and instantly access this information on distributed systems thousands of miles apart through the first computer networks. 

> The United States had unintentionally exploited the artificial existence of Moore’s Law, which dictates, “The capabilities of computers will double every 18 to 24 months(Brock, 34).” Our nation developed the first truly computerized military systems, one such codenamed “ARPANENT(Salus, VIII).” The US even had the audacity to publicly announce what is now popularly referred to as “Project Star Wars(Cort, 77-78),” an idea born from the West’s technological capabilities to place low-earth-orbit satellites in space capable of deflecting Western bound ICBMs(Cort, 78-79). The Soviet Union was in no place to even attempt such a feat, as the rampant technological inadequacies of the USSR culminated in the global embarrassment to the capabilities of the Soviet sciences during the failure of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl in 1986. 

> If there ever was a wakeup call to Soviet leadership, this was it.

</p>
</details>

I understood that runaway technical debt from the failure to automate ‘high-touch’ processes is what led to the collapse of the USSR; modern day tech firms are operationally no different and just as susceptible to the illusion of stability that unwavering adherence to ‘tradition’  can bring.

<details><summary>Arguments for Empirical Software Engineering Adoption</summary>
<p>

I argue that monolithic ITILv3 driven cultures are the most vulnerable, due to the divisional silos that result from unintentional adherence to industry SOPs that have becomes relics and artifacts of the past with the rise of AGILE and LEAN technology governance ways of doing things in ITILv4.

<details><summary>Empirical Software Engineering: From Discipline to Interdiscipline</summary>
<p>

The following excerpt from the following [paper](https://itrau.co/gh-ebse2) is the smoking gun I needed to confirm a suspiciion, a feeling, a spidey-sense if you feel, that the 'high touch' software discipline of the educational learning model used throughout the 'coding bootcamp' industry has not yet been exposed to EBP in the classroom...

> Although recent developments have improved our empirical understanding of software engineering practices and processes, the current state of evidence is still weak when compared to other more mature fields. A large extent of our everyday practice in software engineering is still governed more by conventional wisdom than it is governed by empirical evidence. This is especially true for the social, cultural, and political aspects of software engineering, such as early stages of development, rendering the inference of robust theories inherently problem- atic.

> Even though we can observe an increase of empirical studies in the various fields of software engineering research, many studies still do provide either circumstantial evidence by focusing on isolated contexts without taking into account the relation to existing evidence or – worse – they neglect the context completely. The effects are portrayed by Jacobson’s observation in context of the SEMAT initiative [35]: software engineering is gravely hampered by (1) the prevalence of fads more typical of fashion industry than of an engineering discipline; (2) the lack of a sound, widely accepted theoretical basis; (3) the huge number of methods and method variants, with differences little understood and artificially magnified; (4) the lack of credible experimental evaluation and validation; and finally (5) the split between industry practice and academic research. The consequence of the current situation are best described by Wohlin et al. saying that
 
> “there exists no generally accepted theory in software engineering [...]. Some laws3, hypotheses and conjectures exist, but yet no generally accepted theory” [36]. As a matter of fact, a large extent of the theories (or theory patterns) we have for soft- ware engineering are still transferred from theories in other disciplines (e.g. organisational psychology), sometimes by adopting them, but mostly by transferring them verbatim [37].

> Software engineering itself however is often still governed by folklore turned into facts [38]. Similarly as in other fields before, many theories specific to software engineering emerged from the early times of the discipline where empiricism had no significance at all and where claims by authorities where often treated as facts. One prominent example for such a “fact” is grounded in the wellknown essay by Edsger Dijkstra Go To Statement Considered Harmful [39] from 1968, largely based on reasoning by argument and triggering a public exchange between different scholars via published notes (all considering the previous note as “harmful” itself). Although this exchange fostered an important and fruitful debate in the community at that time, it still remained largely a public exchange between scholars based on reasoning by argument. This did not change until 2015, nearly 50 years lager, when Nagappan et al. [40] published the results of their largescale study analysing C code from GitHub repositories and suggesting that the use of goto statements in practice does not appear to be harmful.
</p>
</details>

Additionally, this applies to countless enterprise technology-first environments and teams... 

<details><summary>ITILv3 is Legacy</summary>
<p>

ITILv3 is so obsessed with process improvement in the form of written proposals, that metrics and KPIs of any type are never implimented, so the decision makers in such orgs remain in the dark to their actual state of tech.

The adoption of evidence-based practice approach methodologies as a key component of organizational technology governance strategies acts as a safeguard against 'tradition' and the folklore behind institutionalized SOPs that exist in the form of 'we have always done it this way.' 

I do not have actual numbers or stats, but, past experience in ITILv3 IT and Kanban/DevOps SE environments has provided me with the insight to know that the 'eye opening' reality for most orgs doesn't occur until an outsider with no understanding of current processes is brought in. 

EBSD adoption goes far beyond the capabilities of Splunk, Nagios, or monitoring tools of any type, because it is something that does not exist as an off the shelf tool; it's a mindset, a perspective, a way of looking at things and searching for scientific, peer reviewed papers and case studies to assess and test the situation.

</p>
</details> 

EBSD enables an or on every level to exist in a constant state of evolution in response to new and emerging discoveries that drive innovation from the bottom-up, not the top-down.

EBSD is both an art and a science sprinkled with a liberal arts style of critical thinking and analysis that allows an org to exist in a fluidic state of continous enhancement.

## The Stigma

<details><summary>Killing the 'Coding Bootcamp Graduate' Stigma</summary>
<p>

"Coding bootcamp graduates are NOT engineers..." is what I was told by Senior Software Engineers, but, what I now realize is that this field lacks credible theory and is based largely on 'tradition,' in the absence of inquiry into the multidimensional state of this field through the analysis of the scientific method and the collective advancement towards credible theories, the entire basis for their arguments exists as a house of cards on a straw foundation that is just one huff, and buff, away from being blown into oblivion...

I argue that it is the diversity of the interdisciplinary educational backgrounds of code school grads that empowers us with the knowledge to view the 'state of things' in this field from an entirely outside perspective that will enable, for the first time, establish concrete theories in this field; it is this advantage that we have over the classically trained Ivy League-educated software engineers of the past. 

Their argument is based on 'tradition,' folklore, and conjecture that's the equivalent of the pseudosciences, and our interdisciplinary backgrounds threaten to expose that reality...

The term software engineering was coined in 1968, at the NATO Software Engineering Conference by the conference chairman 'Bauer' he stated,

```
What we need is software engineering.
```
    
This was the world of a 1960s era 'Mad Men' episode, it portrays the 'boys club' masculinity at its peak in America, and it is this culture of exclusion to women and colored minorities that serves as the founding fathers of 'software engineering' as a field study. 

It was this moment in history when the rise of 'nerd masculinity' began to take hold on the field and establish the barriers to diversity and inclusion that still exist today...

The greatest threat to the status quo of modern-day senior 'software engineers' is the 'God In Gaps' reveal to its existence that is well underway at this moment in time and evident through the continued call to arms to deliver on overdue promises for diversity and inclusion in the upper ranks of every sector.

I argue, that, with the arrival of the mainstreaming of the coding bootcamp phenomena underway today, that the interdisciplinary professional and educational background of student developers brings with it the risk of new perspectives and frameworks of scientific inquiry from fields with robust theories that can be applied to the state of software engineering practices, norms, and beliefs.

Code school graduates are the gateway for a pool of technical talent with the expertise and a fresh perspective that threaten the state of ‘tradition’ as outsiders turned jury. 

As a founding member of Out In Tech ATL, I am obligated to take this argument into the halls of academia to fight fire with fire. 

We have been stigmatized as being a 'bootleg' caste of wannabe technophiles by the Ivy League-educated software engineers of yesteryear who have failed for fifty years to establish theory that can be peer-review duplicated, it is the absence of doctrine based on the principles of the scientific method that invalidates any claim they have to being  'scientists.' 

```
extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence.

- Carl Sagan
```

This has quote has been a guiding principle of my life since I was kid, I idolize Sagan and his legacy.

## EBP vs. EBSD
<details><summary>Expanding</summary>
<p>

I have come to the conclusion that the term 'Evidence-based Software Design' decribes the traditional process of software development on a team with a least one developer as a 'practitioner' of empirical software engineering. 

EBP, in all of its many forms, should be considered a highly structured way of viewing the world of software engineering through frameworks of scientific inquiry from fields with well established theories. 

EBP is not something an org can simply adopt, but it is something that can be implimnented through the selection and hiring of former EBP pracitioners turned code school graduates whose background and prior achievements in an outside field of study are verifiable.  

There is a lot of expanding I need to do on this, but, the end goal here is to drive EBSD an interdisciplinary.  
</p>

## A Return to Academia && Tech Leadership

<details><summary>Grad School</summary>
<p>

Without a doubt, I will be entering a graduate program in the next 24 months to pursue an advanced degree with a focus on some aspect of technology...

However, at this time, it is far to early to decide what that degree will be because I don't have a purpose or mission in this industry. 

The purpose of an advanced degree is strategic in nature, and should only be started by someone with an established presence in a specific field or industry; grad school is a highly calculated decision that requires extensive research.

The tactical advantage of a highly vetted graduate program is the emergence of deep analytical awareness for the conceptual frameworks at the heart of an industry or field. 

At this time, I have no mentors or leaders in the tech industry or IT field that I lookup to for guidance and professional career development; my status and influence at Apple was strictly limited to my org in Austin, at this time, I am a nobody. 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Apple Leadership</summary>
<p>

Tara Bunch, the SVP of my former org at Apple serves as a testament to the power of strong leadership, and, to this day, the message of her 2013 'One Apple' vision of a unified global company culture still inspires me.

Apple was so much more than just a 'job' to me, it was a way of life. Apple, as a company, became a critical part of my identity. To this stay, I still say 'we' when referring to my time at the company.

Tim Cook, Apple's current CEO, who leads an army of 100,000+ strong, replied within minutes of sending him an email about my roommate, who was a part-time Apple Store employee, having to take on a second part-time job to cover the upfront cost of tuition for the same college class that our third roommate, a corporate part-time Apple employee, had secured a delayed payment agreement for due the tuition assistance benefit that Apple corporate employees working 20+ hours week are elligible for...     

The question I asked was simple, "Are we really 'One Apple'?"

The impact of this chain reaction resulted in the full expansion of company benefits that all PT corporate employees working 20 or more hours a week were are eligible for being extended to all PT retail store employees working the same number of hours in late 2014; I have no idea what went on behind closed doors in Cuptertino after this, I obviously had no part anything beyond speaking up for something I thought Apple Leadership should know... 

I may have left Apple, but the company remains a core part of my identity to this day, and likely will until the day I die.  
</p>
</details>


<details><summary>The Absence of Leadership</summary>
<p>

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>April 2020 GRE</summary>
<p>

I knew years ago that I wanted to pursue an advanced graduate degree, I even started a Masters in IS in 2016 and completed three classes before leaving Apple and losing my tuition assistance benefits.  

I had transferred my AS in nursing to SNHU, with a goal of completing a BS in IT, but after three years of taking one class a term with more then a few terms off in order to focus on Apple, I still had at least 1 1/2 years left to go.

I began prepping in October of last year and am proud of myself for sticking to the 15 hour a week study/prep plan I produced; I I am officially registered for the April 26th 2020 Graduate Record Examination!

### Terms A - Z
<details><summary>A - Z</summary>
<p>

- Evidence-based Practice(EBP): Any practice that relies on scientific and mathematical evidence to form strong inductive or deductive arguments for guidance and decision-making. Practices that are not evidence-based may rely on tradition, intuition, or other unproven methods.
- Evidence-based Software Design(EBSD): A personally coined term that is fully interchangeable with Empirical Software Engineering(ESE) that denote the exact same thing/idea.
- Empirical Software Engineering(ESE): Is a research area concerned with the empirical observation of software engineering artifacts and the empirical validation of software engineering theories and assumptions.
- Software Engineering(SE): the creation and maintenance of software. But from a research perspective, software engineering is the body of knowledge about the creation and maintenance of software and about the phenomena underlying and emerging from those two activities.
- Post-Mortem Analysis(PMA):  An empirical study method in software engineering. It is an important, but often forgotten, way of gathering empirical knowledge. PMA is ideally performed either soon after the most important milestones and events or at the end of a project, both in s uccessful and unsuccessful software development projects. The benefit is that post-mortems can often reveal findings more frequently and differently than project completion reports alone.
