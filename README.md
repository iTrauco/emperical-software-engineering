Aligning my background with the world of Software Engineering through a decades long interdisciplinary history of industrial design, textile engineering, and a deeply engrained awareness for the ideals of evidence-based practice empiricism has been hard for me; the following words defined the spirit of a passion project called Nerdy Pug Studios that closed overnight in 2018 due to platform-dependence on Etsy... 

**Our evolving identity is a fusion of multiple stereotypical industry traits, combined with a strong respect and adherence to the empirical and evidence-based practice approach methodologies. We're science geeks, and our creations, particularly our harnesses, are the result of extensive research, development, and prototyping.**

<details open><summary>My Experience</summary>
<p>

In the months since my code school graduation, the 00:00:00 timestamps that litter my [DigitalCrafts](https://digitalcrafts.com) GitHub era private repos have enabled me to use the recorded video lectures for a post-mortem analysis of my student developer experience at DigitalCrafts; and the insights I have gained from this process have been life-altering. 

[Chris Aquino(@radishmouse)](https://github.com/radishmouse) was an exceptional instructor, and, in rewatching and listening to every recorded video lecture at least 2 -3 times over again, I now understand the message and direction he and the DIRS were trying to guide me to when I was a student developer.

<details><summary>Hour:Minute:Second TimeStamps & Recorded Video Lectures</summary>
<p>

<br> New material is covered so fast in a full-time, immersive code school classroom that even with my ability to type upwards of 100+ WPM, I found it impossible to jot down notes for everything I wanted to during lecture. 

As a result, by week 3 or 4, I had adopted the use of timestamps as placement holders in the code I uploaded to GitHub that allowed me to backtrack to a specific moment in the recorded lecture videos very efficiently by corellating the timestamp with the clock time of my instructors Mac in the Hours:Minutes:Seconds format. </br>

Line four of the code block below highlights my usage of the Hour:Minute:Second format timestamp in my code, the full GitHub code block can be reviewed [here](https://itrau.co/0502lecture1).

As a former IT Admin, I knew that I would have to backup and preserve any/all DC provided recorded video lectures, and I did...

I have every single lecture cataloged privately on YouTube , with the timestamps in the code tagged to the video playback time.

For example 

```javascript

<details><summary>Imposter Syndrome</summary>
<p>

A few years ago, I started a Masters in Information Systems(IS) but stopped taking classes after completing 1/2 of my program because I was plateaued in my IT career due to an ability to code/program. 

I was always been embarrassed by the BA in General Studies on my resume, so much so that I let the self-doubt of imposter syndrome consume me in my post-DigitalCrafts software industry job search. 

My technical/IT background landed me interviews that most code school grads would have been passed over for by HR/IT Recruiters, and I witnessed firsthand the ‘stigma’ of the ‘coding bootcamp graduate’ stereotype that so many Senior SEs hold. 

This 'stigma' is widespread due to the rise of 'nerd-masculinity' in the field of computer science that occured in 1970s to early 1980s as the sector transitioned from a female dominated one to a male dominated one; and it remains widespread through senior level engineering positions in all sectors. 

<details><summary>NETWORKS OF EXCLUSION IN A GENDERED ORGANIZATION IN THE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY</summary>
<p>

I found the following passage from this [research paper](https://itrau.co/GenderNetworks) particularly insightful on the topic... 

> The masculinization of software and computing occurred later in the 20th century, as again men actively worked to professionalize the field in line with other scientific disciplines, establishing structural and cultural boundaries in ways that excluded women from the field (Misa 2010). Newly-implemented aptitude tests and personality profiling in hiring processes, for example, privileged masculine characteristics. Increasingly specialized job titles and hierarchies distanced high-skilled labor from work seen as low status and routine, offering increased social status, greater autonomy, better pay, and improved opportunities for advancement for men (Ensmenger 2010). As men solidified their hold over computing and engineering, computer culture became associated with “nerds” – young, white, educated men who “tinker” with technology.

## Little Known Facts About Me...

<details><summary>One</summary>
<p>

Is that I am/was a nurse, I graduated from Gordon State College in December 2012 with an Associates of Science in Nursing and immediately passed my NCLEX for RN licensure; which I let expire years ago after joining the ranks of Apple corporate. 

I worked professionally as a nurse for a month before quitting, the emotional toll of a career surrounded by illness and death and loosing patients on a daily basis was something I could not do. 

The science of modern day nursing education is housed in a school of scientific inquiry and thought known as evidence-based practice(EBP); which requires, at its core, strict and unwavering adherence to the scientific method in the clinical decision making process for the gathering, collection, and analysis of nursing process interventions. 

Basically, the human body is viewed as a collection of interconnected systems that, in the absence of homeostatic equilibrium, results the breakdown of things over time… 

Blood lab values, toxicology reports, vital signs, urine labs, etc, serve the purpose of providing quantitative data that modern day nurses interpret based on the presenting signs and symptoms of a patient to determine the best steps to take with the end goal of reestablishing a patients natural homeostatic state.

<p>

What drew me to medicine was an encounter with Central Asia bound Doctors Without Borders nurses during a fall 2009 academic study abroad at Moscow State University in Russia; I felt the energy of their cause and canceled plans to attend UGA for Russian Studies...

I lived in Moscow for six months, and in the summer of 2012, I attended Belarussian State University in Minsk, Belarus for six weeks; every two years since then I have returned to Minsk for a two - three week trip abroad.

I studied Russian at Georgia Tech as a dual-enrollment student during my time at Gordon College, and fell in love with everything GT...

## EBP in Software Engineering 

<details><summary>Is known as Empirical Software Engineering...</summary>
<p>

Technology, distributed computer systems, coding workflows, networks, etc, are nothing more then interconnected systems that breakdown over time just like the human body, with performance and monitoring metrics/KPIs as the equivalent of toxicology screenings and blood lab values in the operational decisions making process of corrective systems ops interventions. 

Evidence-based practice approach methodologies in the realm of software engineering and design are relatively new concepts, until recently, EBP empiricism simply did not exist in this field. 

I now know that it was this lack of EBP at the heart of my struggles to grasp something as simple as Test Driven Development(TDD); even though I had long demonstrated a technical prowess for the single-direction logic of organizational Domain Driven Design(DDD) on teams in where the TDD subset of Behavorial Driven Design(BDD) was the norm. 

After months of objective reflection and analysis, I finally located EBP in this field, where is more commonly referred to as Emperical Software Engineering(ESE), but, for the sake of simplicity and habit, I call it Evidence-based Software Design(EBSD).

## EBP is Interdisciplinary

<details><summary>An Evolving Perspective...</summary>
<p>

Four years ago, I wrote the following words in my last undergraduate [research paper](itrau.co/soviettech)...

<details><summary> How Gorbachev's Reforms Synergized the Intentions of the Reagan Doctrine</summary>
<p>

> To highlight the nature of the inefficiencies plaguing the Soviet Union’s industrial capabilities, a review of the technological challenges faced by Gorbachev when he assumed the Office of the General Secretary provides sufficient illustration(Gibbs, 11-14). In 1977, the last year of reliable data, there were an estimated 20,000 computers in the entire Soviet Union, compared to 325,000 in the United States alone(Bailer, 77). It is estimated that by the mid-1980s, there were 25 computers in the United States for every 1 in the Soviet Union, a ratio of 25/1(Bailer, 77).  With a twenty year headstart on research in the newly emerged field of computer science, the West leveraged the power of the microprocessor to automate tasks, calculate vast quantities of data in ever shorter periods of time, and instantly access this information on distributed systems thousands of miles apart through the first computer networks. 

> The United States had unintentionally exploited the artificial existence of Moore’s Law, which dictates, “The capabilities of computers will double every 18 to 24 months(Brock, 34).” Our nation developed the first truly computerized military systems, one such codenamed “ARPANENT(Salus, VIII).” The US even had the audacity to publicly announce what is now popularly referred to as “Project Star Wars(Cort, 77-78),” an idea born from the West’s technological capabilities to place low-earth-orbit satellites in space capable of deflecting Western bound ICBMs(Cort, 78-79). The Soviet Union was in no place to even attempt such a feat, as the rampant technological inadequacies of the USSR culminated in the global embarrassment to the capabilities of the Soviet sciences during the failure of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl in 1986. 

> If there ever was a wakeup call to Soviet leadership, this was it.

</p>
</details>

I understood that runaway technical debt from the failure to automate ‘high-touch’ processes is what led to the collapse of the USSR; modern day tech firms are operationally no different and just as susceptible to the illusion of stability that unwavering adherence to ‘tradition’  can bring.

<details><summary>Arguments for Empirical Software Engineering Adoption</summary>
<p>

I argue that monolithic ITILv3 driven cultures are the most vulnerable, due to the divisional silos that result from unintentional adherence to industry SOPs that have becomes relics and artifacts of the past with the rise of AGILE and LEAN technology governance ways of doing things in ITILv4.

<details><summary>Empirical Software Engineering: From Discipline to Interdiscipline</summary>
<p>

The following excerpt from the following [paper](https://itrau.co/gh-ebse2) is the smoking gun I needed to confirm a suspiciion, a feeling, a spidey-sense if you feel, that the 'high touch' software discipline of the educational learning model used throughout the 'coding bootcamp' industry has not yet been exposed to EBP in the classroom...

> Although recent developments have improved our empirical understanding of software engineering practices and processes, the current state of evidence is still weak when compared to other more mature fields. A large extent of our everyday practice in software engineering is still governed more by conventional wisdom than it is governed by empirical evidence. This is especially true for the social, cultural, and political aspects of software engineering, such as early stages of development, rendering the inference of robust theories inherently problem- atic.

> Even though we can observe an increase of empirical studies in the various fields of software engineering research, many studies still do provide either circumstantial evidence by focusing on isolated contexts without taking into account the relation to existing evidence or – worse – they neglect the context completely. The effects are portrayed by Jacobson’s observation in context of the SEMAT initiative [35]: software engineering is gravely hampered by (1) the prevalence of fads more typical of fashion industry than of an engineering discipline; (2) the lack of a sound, widely accepted theoretical basis; (3) the huge number of methods and method variants, with differences little understood and artificially magnified; (4) the lack of credible experimental evaluation and validation; and finally (5) the split between industry practice and academic research. The consequence of the current situation are best described by Wohlin et al. saying that
 
> “there exists no generally accepted theory in software engineering [...]. Some laws3, hypotheses and conjectures exist, but yet no generally accepted theory” [36]. As a matter of fact, a large extent of the theories (or theory patterns) we have for soft- ware engineering are still transferred from theories in other disciplines (e.g. organisational psychology), sometimes by adopting them, but mostly by transferring them verbatim [37].

> Software engineering itself however is often still governed by folklore turned into facts [38]. Similarly as in other fields before, many theories specific to software engineering emerged from the early times of the discipline where empiricism had no significance at all and where claims by authorities where often treated as facts. One prominent example for such a “fact” is grounded in the wellknown essay by Edsger Dijkstra Go To Statement Considered Harmful [39] from 1968, largely based on reasoning by argument and triggering a public exchange between different scholars via published notes (all considering the previous note as “harmful” itself). Although this exchange fostered an important and fruitful debate in the community at that time, it still remained largely a public exchange between scholars based on reasoning by argument. This did not change until 2015, nearly 50 years lager, when Nagappan et al. [40] published the results of their largescale study analysing C code from GitHub repositories and suggesting that the use of goto statements in practice does not appear to be harmful.
</p>
</details>

Additionally, this applies to countless enterprise technology-first environments and teams... 

<details><summary>ITILv3 is Legacy AF</summary>
<p>

ITILv3 is so obsessed with processes improvement in the form of written proposals, that metrics and KPIs of any type are never implimented, so the decision makers in such orgs remain in the dark to their actual state of tech.

The adoption of evidence-based practice approach methodologies as a key component of organizational technology governance strategies acts as a safeguard against 'tradition' and the folklore behind institutionalized SOPs that exist in the form of 'we have always done it this way.' 

I do not have actual numbers or stats, but, past experience in ITILv3 IT and Kanban/DevOps SE environments has provided me with the insight to know that the 'eye opening' reality for most orgs doesn't occur until an outsider with no understanding of current processes is brought in. 

EBSD adoption goes far beyond the capabilities of Splunk, Nagios, or monitoring tools of any type, because it is something that does not exist as an off the shelf tool; it's a mindset, a perspective, a way of looking at things and searching for scientific, peer reviewed papers and case studies to assess and test the situation.

</p>
</details> 

EBSD requires an org, on every level, to exist in a constant state of evolution in response to new and emerging discoveries that drive innovation from the bottom-up, not the top-down.

EBSD is both an art and a science sprinkled with a liberal arts style of critical thinking and analysis that allows an org to exist in a fluidic state of continous enhancement.

## Current Work

<details><summary>Killing the 'Coding Bootcamp' Stigma</summary>
<p>

I consider any/all DC graduates engineers, on the same level as myself, because DC is a school, an institution, dedicated to the art of educating students in the science of the coding workflow processes needed to establish a lifelong career in the world of tech; unlike ‘coding bootcamps,’ which I view as assembly lines turning out fresh patches of junior developers ‘every three weeks.’

There is a clear and present distinction between the quality of the education I received at DC vs. what I would have learned somewhere with 20+ nationwide locations...

"Coding bootcamp graduates are NOT engineers..." is what I was told by Senior Software Engineers, but, what I now realize is that this field lacks credible theory and is based largely on 'tradition,' in the absence of inquiry into the multidimensional state of this field through the analysis of the scientific method and the collective advancement towards credible theories, the entire basis for their arguments exists as a house of cards on a straw foundation that is just one huff, and buff, away from being blown into oblivion...

I argue that it is the diversity of the interdisciplinary educational backgrounds of code school grads that empowers us with the knowledge to view the 'state of things' in this field from an entirely outside perspective that will enable, for the first time, the establishment of concrete theories in this field; it is this advantage that we have over the classically trained software engineers of Ivey League engineers. 

Their argument is based on 'tradition,' folklore, and conjecture that's the equivalent of the pseudosciences, and our interdisciplinary backgrounds threaten to expose that reality...

The term software engineering was coined in 1968, at the NATO Software Engineering Conference by the conference chairman 'Bauer' he stated,

```
What we need is software engineering...
```
    
This was the world of a 1960s era 'Mad Men' episode, it portrays the 'boys club' masculinity at its peak in America, and it is this culture of exclusion to women and colored minorities that coined the term 'software engineering.'

It was this moment in history when the rise of 'nerd masculinity' began to take hold on the field and establish the barriers to diversity and inclusion that exist today...

The greatest threat to the status quo of modern-day senior 'software engineers' is the 'God In Gaps' reveal to its existence that is well underway at this moment in time and evident through the continued call to arms to delivery on the overdue promises for diversity and inclusion in the upper ranks of every sector.

I argue, that, with the arrival of the mainstreaming of the coding bootcamp phenomena underway today, that the interdisciplinary professional and educational background of student developers brings with it the risk of new perspectives and frameworks of scientific inquiry from fields with robust theories that can be applied to the state of software engineering practices, norms, and beliefs.

Code school graduates are the gateway for a pool of technical talent with the expertise and a fresh perspective that threaten the state of ‘tradition’ as outsiders turned jury. 

As a founding member of Out In Tech ATL, I am obligated to take this argument into the halls of academia and fight fire with fire. 

We have been stigmatized as being a 'bootleg' caste of wannabe technophiles by the Ivey League educated software engineers of yesteryear who have failed for fifty years to establish theory that can be peer-review duplicated, it is the absence of doctrine based on the principles of the scientific method that invalidates any claim they have to being 'scientists.'
